## Dev notes

- `make start` to start server

- iterate on the `develop` branch (css changes, etc)
  
- push to `master` when ready

- bundler (`_/Gemfile`) is here to keep github-pages gems consistent

## What's here

- `_/` - boilerplate stuff are placed here as much as possible.

- `/pages/ref.html` - style references

## TODO

- [ ] figure out what to do with tags.
- [ ] move pages and references.
- [ ] better index of items.
- [ ] author footer.
