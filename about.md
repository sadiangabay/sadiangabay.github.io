I am an adventurer, traveller, student.

I believe

  Make someone happy today (me)
  Make everything as simple as possible, but not simpler. (Albert Einstein)
  Don’t make me think. (Steve Krug)
  People that think well, write well. (David Ogilvy)
  Omit needless words. (Strunk & White)
  Do one thing and do it right. (37signals)
  Good is the enemy of great. (Jim Collins)
  Stay hungry, stay foolish. (Steve Jobs)
  Life shrinks or expands in proportion to ones’ courage (Anais Nin)
